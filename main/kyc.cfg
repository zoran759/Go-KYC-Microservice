# The configuration format is ini-like with the few simple rules:
#
# - this is a comment line;
# - inline comments are not allowed;
# - comments and empty lines allowed everywhere in the config and will be skipped;
# - KYC provider names must be enclosed in brackets;
# - provider options have the format key=value without quotes and whitespaces between the equal sign and their parts;
# - outer whitespaces will be trimmed in all lines;
# - it's expected that first must be a name followed by options.
